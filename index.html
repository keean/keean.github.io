            <p>
                The aim is to document my progress towards implementing a new
                programming language. The goals of the language are:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>To facilitate generic, and datatype generic programming.</li>
                <li>Low level code can directly manipulate bits and bytes.</li>
                <li>High level abstractions suitable for very large projects.</li>
                <li>You don't pay for what you don't use.</li>
                <li>To favour cheap reusable abstraction.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The overall design is to allow low level imperative code, after
                being proved safe by the type system, to be treated as values, and
                manipulated by a higher level generic functional code. The type
                system is based on parametric polymorphism with the addition of a
                type-level logic language to express constraints on code.
